# SocietyObjects #

SocietyObjects for Starcounter 2.0

### Installation instructions ###
1. Download this code from GIT
2. Since SocietyObjects often is used with other projects it is using a environment variable to decide where to put the binaries.
    - Goto Advanced System Settings (control panel->system and security->system in W 8.1)
    - Open Environement Variables...
    - Add a system variable named "SocietyObjects" with value "path to output" (Ex. "C:\SO")
3. Open project in Visual Studio 2012 and compile. (Visual studio need to be restarted after step 2.)
